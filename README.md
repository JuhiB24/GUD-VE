– This proposed visualization tool was created to determine the structure and biological functions by enunciating the physic-
ochemical properties of primary sequences of proteins.
– This tool analyzes two protein sequences at a time and compares them based on their physicochemical parameters like
Aliphatic index, GRAVY, molecular weight, atomic compositions, etc.
– tkinter library was used to create an in-built application for the tool.
– Several python libraries were used including the matplotlib and seaborn libraries for comparison of the proteins based on
graphs.
